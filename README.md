# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

This project aims to build a **Movie Recommendation System** using collaborative filtering techniques. The system uses data on user ratings to recommend movies to users based on their preferences and viewing history. Built with **Python**, **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, and **surprise** (for collaborative filtering), this project showcases a common recommendation algorithm to provide personalized movie suggestions.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Build a recommendation system to suggest movies to users
- Implement collaborative filtering using user-item interactions (ratings)
- Compare different recommendation techniques: 
  - **Memory-based** (User-User or Item-Item)
  - **Model-based** (Matrix Factorization)

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: The dataset used for this project is the **MovieLens dataset**. You can download it from [here](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
- **Data Description**:
  - `movies.csv`: Movie titles, genres
  - `ratings.csv`: User ratings for movies (userID, movieID, rating)
  - Optional: `tags.csv`, `links.csv`

> 📌 Note: Place the dataset in a `data/` directory.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Cleaning**
   - Load the dataset (movies, ratings)
   - Handle missing values and duplicates

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Distribution of ratings
   - Most popular movies
   - User preferences and ratings patterns

3. **Collaborative Filtering**
   - **Memory-based**: Compute similarity between users or items (e.g., Cosine Similarity, Pearson Correlation)
   - **Model-based**: Matrix Factorization (e.g., using Singular Value Decomposition, SVD)

4. **Model Training**
   - Split data into training and testing sets
   - Train models using `surprise` or `scikit-learn`
   - Evaluate performance with RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) or MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

5. **Recommendations**
   - Generate recommendations for users based on model predictions
   - Provide top N movie recommendations for each user

🌱 Future Improvements

🔮 Hybrid Approach: Combine collaborative filtering with content-based recommendations.
🌍 Diversity & Personalization: Filter recommendations based on user preferences (e.g., genres, actors).
📱 Web Application: Build a web app using Flask or Streamlit for interactive recommendations.
🔄 Real-time recommendations: Implement real-time data updates or integrate with movie APIs like TMDb or OMDB.
